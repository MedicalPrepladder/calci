## Calci


* Purpose: 
For this assignment, use React JS ( JSX ).This assignment is to be used only for Coding skill (DRY), accuracy , Programming style(OOPs / Functional Programming) etc. 



## Software Conventions: 

* Language:  JS, JSX, CSS, HTML.

	
## Overall Description: 

The product will work as a scientific calculator which will have the following features:

# Steps 1 **(Custom Web pack Configure)** 					            
	
	 *Configure Webpack with Babel Presets, ES Lint, Post CSS Config with autoprefixer (‘> 1 %’).*

	 *Build Directory   (Config Webpack for this).*



    **FILE TYPE	                     OUTPUT**

        HTML	                    ./Build/index.html
        CSS	                        ./build/static/cs/style.css
        JS                       	./build/static/js/script.js
        Assets	                    ./build/static/assets/





# Steps 2 **(Design)**: 									 

	*Use any type of layout method (Flex, Grids, and Floats).*




 Product Perspective:

 					
       **Key	                                    Function**
                                             
        ←                                     	    Show all past results.

        AC	                                        Clear All values from the input text.

        +/-	                                        Enters minus symbol or sign change key. Changes positive numbers to                                                 negative and negative numbers to positive.

        %	                                        For calculating percentages.

        +,-,/,x	                                    + (addition), – (subtraction), x (multiplication), and  / (division).

        =                                           Finds the result in the same way as a standard calculator

        X! (Factorial)	                            The product of a given positive integer n multiplied by all the lesser                                              positive integers from 1 to n-1 is indicated by n! and called the                                                   factorial of n.

        eⁿ	                                        Calculates exponential values.

        x√y	                                        Calculates the xth root of y. i.e


* Example:

    4√(625) = 5  means 5^4 = 5*5*5*5 = 625.   

    2√ (49)= 7  means 7*7 = 49.

    d/dx	Calculate derivative only for e^x



# Steps 3 (Code):                            *No USE OF npm packages accept webpack configuration*


    **Coding style must be functional programming / OOPs.**

    **Create one hash function that store previous all results on back click. Do not use the browser’s local storage,         cookies, and session storage.**

    **Calculator also perform first negative operative number example**
        - 10 - 10 = -20
        - 10 * - 10 = 100
        
    **Calculate derivative only for e^x.(derivative must perform this).**






* Steps 4 (Testing):

Write Test case for (use any tool Jest, Mocha and jasmine).
